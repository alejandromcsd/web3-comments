# Web3 Forum with Polygon

### Project Details

I've built a fullstack decentralized (Web3 - Solidity Smart Contracts) forum that can be used in any dapp. Idea is based on this [guide](https://www.pointer.gg/tutorials/create-a-web3-forum-with-polygon/1cb8f005-08f4-48a2-9d82-cd963e16f7f1)

### Ingredients

- 🚀 React 17
- 🌎 React-Query - Async state management
- 🪝 wagmi - React Hooks for Ethereum
- 🎨 Chakra UI - Component Library
- 👷🏽‍♂️ Hardhat - Ethereum development environment
- 🧪 Wafffle - Smart contract testing framework
- 💰 Ethers - Ethereum wallet implementation

### Overview

Deployable smart contract and an accompanying React component to add comment threads to your dapps.

In theory this could be open sourced and published as an npm package to allow any developer to quickly add a forum to their dapp.

Here's a demo:
